This project demonstrates the integration of LabView automated tools into the self-driving lab software [IvoryOS](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ivoryOS-MCP). The ability to control IvoryOS through Claude with an MCP interface allows to control the LabView software through natural language and easily integrate intelligent experimental design.

## üöÄ Quick Start

After running the 'main.py' file, the TCP server used to control the LabVIEW software can be started by clicking Devices ‚Üí Chamber ‚Üí Start Server. Then, the LabVIEW software needs to be started and the connection can be ensured by clicking *Is Connected* in the prior Ivory OS menu.

Afterwards, the LabVIEW software can be controlled either directly from the web interface or alternatively through natural language using the Claude interface:

- **LabVIEW Control**: Interface to the PVD system hardware

## üë• Team
Developed during the [LLM Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science & Chemistry](https://llmhackathon.github.io/) as part of [Ivory Zhang‚Äôs team](https://github.com/ivoryzh/MCP4SDL) in the Hein Lab at The University of British Columbia, this repository builds on the MCP server and provides an extended implementation.
